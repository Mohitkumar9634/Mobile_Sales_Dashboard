ðŸš€ Just Mastered Interactive Dashboards in Power BI! ðŸ“Š

Excited to share that Iâ€™ve recently leveled up my Power BI skills by learning to create interactive dashboards! From dynamic filters to visually compelling data storytelling, Iâ€™ve explored how to turn raw data into actionable insights.

Hereâ€™s a glimpse of what Iâ€™ve learned:
âœ” Dynamic Filtering: Allowing users to drill down by categories like Mobile Model, Payment Method, and Time Periods.
âœ” MTD/YTD Analysis: Tracking Month-to-Date and Year-to-Date sales trends for better decision-making.
âœ” Data Visualization: Crafting intuitive charts (e.g., Total Sales by City, Units by Month) to highlight key metrics.
âœ” User Interactivity: Enabling seamless toggles between All or specific segments for deeper analysis.

The attached dashboards showcase:

Total Sales performance (e.g., $769M MTD).

Breakdowns by brand, payment method, and geography.

Time-based comparisons (Same Period Last Year).

Power BIâ€™s ability to transform complex data into clear, interactive stories is a game-changer for businesses. Excited to apply these skills to drive data-driven decisions!
